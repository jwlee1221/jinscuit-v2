# A summer at TU Dresden, Germany

As the spring semester came to a frantic end, I was all over the place submitting rushed projects, studying for exams and looking for apartments in the city. Somehow I managed to get on the plane bound for Germany. I remember feeling exhausted, nervous, and relieved at the same time.

I spent the summer of 2022 at the Dresden University of Technology in Germany, as a part of the undergraduate research experience program. During the two months there, I conducted research on the sound design for warning sounds in vehicles. I created 24 sound designs and conducted a listening experiment, and wrote a paper about my findings. As it turns out, there's a reason why many firetrucks around the world have a common roughness about their sirens. More importantly, I learned that we could design sounds that elicit urgency without being overly painful or annoying.

My time in Dresden was an unexpected gift. It gave me time to be bored, to be left to my own devices. I spent many endless hours in the train, without any cell signal. So I stared out the window in quiet and peace. I don't remember experiencing peace in the city. Also, I remember that the sky in Germany was cloudless, tall, and vast.

I also made new friends at the university. We span different cultures, ages, and backgrounds, but everyone was honest and pleasant. We would eat lunch together, drink coffee in the unversity garden together, and go to beergartens during the weekend. I was so lucky to be with sweet and kind people.
