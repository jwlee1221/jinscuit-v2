During the summer of 2023, I worked at AKRF engineering consultant firm as an acoustical engineering intern.

The internship position was fieldwork-based, including noise and vibration surveys for areas such as construction sites, transportation sources, HVAC and mechanical equipment. We used sound level meters and seismographs to collect data, analyzed it, and provided environmental impact reports to our clients.

It was jarring to return to the physical world. After immersing myself in circuit design and MATLAB during the school year, I had to remind myself that people live in the city. I learned how to calibrate sound level meters, set up long-term noise measurements, and analyze octave-band data in post-processing software. I also conducted traffic counts to make future projections, and conducted sound transmission tests across windows and doors as defined by ASTM standards.

No matter what we did, we could not escape frequency domain. Not only did we experience time, but we perceived the world in frequency bands.

But enough of technical talk - the most valuable aspect of this internship was the exposure to this ever-growing, ever-re-developing city. The massive New York City is a unique city where schools, hospitals, and residential buildings rely on strict acoustical codes to keep people's sanity.

When you're standing in a school building next to an elevated train track, and you feel the 100-Hertz rumble on the floor as the 7-train passes by, you begin to appreciate what a single layer of laminated-glass window can make. We live in a city full of uncontrollable variables. Acoustics is a small part of a complex puzzle. The problems that our clients present require solutions that are a careful balancing act of energy efficiency, air quality, environmental protection, acoustics, among others.

There were a few other things that I learned as well:

1. The city is an acoustical maze. When you hear a jackhammer sound in the middle of Manhattan, it's surprisingly difficult to track down where the sound is coming from; the grid becomes a complex maze.

2. Circuit simulations are so similar to acoustical simulation software. These are ideal approximations, and the reality can often be far from the simulation results. But - we all have to start somewhere, right?

3. Good audio compression is vital in annotating recorded audio data. Thank you, ECE413 and professor Hoerning, for teaching me just how important MP3 compression is. Here's to hoping that future sound level meters can record days' worth of audio files with even higher quality!

The summer was a blur, but I learned so much about the city. This experience reminded me why we design electronics and implement algorithm: to tackle real problems.
