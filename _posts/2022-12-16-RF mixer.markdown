# The RF Mixer

In Junior labs, we were tasked to design a single-balanced RF mixer that modulates an RF signal with a 4MHz local oscillator.

Our design is an active single-balanced mixer. In this structure, the RF signal controls the tail current of a differential pair. With each transistor acting as a common-source amplifier, the RF signal gets amplified at each drain node. Meanwhile, the differential LO at the bases determines “how much” each transistor is turned on. The amplified RF signal’s voltage level consequently gets shifted to the biased drain voltages, producing a mixed output at the drain nodes.

We designed a BJT (2N2222) Colpitts oscillator as the LO, which reached 41MHz with a 7.3V peak-to-peak amplitude and consumed 75mW from a 17V power supply. The internal noise from these components would kick-start a signal into the amplifier, and the feedback network would selectively pass the target frequency. This oscillator was also inverted to create a differential input to the mixer.

The active mixer was built using two MOSfet (2N7002) transistors in a differential pair, with passive load at each drain. The tail current is determined by another current source that is operated by the RF signal. This RF signal is provided by a wave generator on our oscilloscope.

We first encountered an issue when building the inverter used to create a differential LO signal. While the oscillator created a steady 4.3 MHz oscillation at 8V peak-to-peak amplitude in isolation, the inverter output was significantly out-of-phase with the input oscillation.

We addressed the oscillator’s imperfect sinusoidal output first. We increased the collector resistance to reduce the peak-to-peak voltage swing of the oscillator and replaced the LC tank feedback with a single crystal (which works together with the parasitic capacitances of the board) to generate a closer-to-ideal sinusoidal output.

At this stage of the project, we had considered using 10kΩ resistors for the input and feedback resistors of the Op-Amp. After considering the lower output impedance (approximately equal to the 3.3k Ω collector resistor) of the crystal oscillator and the lower-than-ideal input impedance of the subsequent common-source stage, we reduced the input resistor of the inverter to 1kΩ and adjusted the feedback resistor to match the inverter’s peak-to-peak amplitude of the oscillator.
