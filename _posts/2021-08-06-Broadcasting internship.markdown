# A summer working in the Network Quality Center at SPOTV broadcasting company

I had an entire 5-month window between being discharged from the Korean army and returning to New York to continue college. Seeing that the army was just another workplace for officers, I was curious how the work culture was in a Korean company. Fortunately, I was accepted into a short-term internship at SPOTV, a sports-focused broadcasting company in Seoul.

Stationed at the Network Quality Center, I was part of the team responsible for testing incoming live satellite signals, routing all incoming signals into the corresponding departments, and maintaining the machine rooms full of encoders and decoders. I learned how to read signal flow diagrams and test video and audio specifications. We could not afford to have any errors during live streams - especially for popular MLB and NBA games!

I also learned what it was like to be in a team that was always on duty. We always needed to have a member in office 24/7, so we needed to take responsibility for hour work schedule. During late-night shifts, my mentor would bring iced coffee and do jumping jacks with me to stay awake as we awaited the feeds to come in. I think our team especially took care for each other because we were the team that couldn't make any mistakes, but also didn't sta have a  stand-out presence in the office.

Another interesting thing: as a radio signaller in the army, I was used to stripping wires and making LAN cables all day long. As it turns out, this skill came in very handy - the broadcasting company was in the middle transitioning its machines room to a completely different office across the Han river.
